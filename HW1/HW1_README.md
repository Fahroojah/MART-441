This was a struggle for me. I took Web Design in 2014 and the class (and the world) looked a little different back then. I spent a fair bit of time brushing up on my CSS.
I leaned pretty heavily on some of the parallax guides [from w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_parallax.asp) to accomplish that.
