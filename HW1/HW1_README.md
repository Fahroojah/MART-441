HW 1

This was a struggle for me. I took Web Design in 2014 and the class (and the world) looked a little different back then. I spent a fair bit of time brushing up on my CSS just to get off the ground.
I leaned pretty heavily on some of the parallax guides [from w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_parallax.asp) to get that effect to work correctly.

Failures & Struggles

I could not get the parallax effect to work correctly from the external style sheet. It would show the 'spacing' of the images correctly, but the images themsleves wouldn't load.
The only way I was able to get it to work was to put it directly into the index.html page.

I the padding/spacing/design of the website is pretty mediorce, but I'm fairly happy considering my starting point.
