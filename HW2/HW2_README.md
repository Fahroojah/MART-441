HW 2
=====

This week was much easier. It was a familiar process to add a .js sheet and attach that to the index. I found it interesting that the background-color took effect even with an image that spans the entire background; it was only noticable if when you dropped the opacity. I was surprised that the two style elements seemed to work together rather than just picking one or the other.

What would happen if you have both a external css and js sheet and have them both change the same thing; ie one changed bg color to blue and one to red; does it combine? Does one take precedent over the other? Is it how they're called in the HTML doc?
